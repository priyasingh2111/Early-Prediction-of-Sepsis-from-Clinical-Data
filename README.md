# Early-Prediction-of-Sepsis-from-Clinical-Data
Implemented machine learning models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, Neural Network) for early sepsis prediction, achieving an F1 score of 0.85.
Conducted in-depth analysis, addressing challenges such as correlation, missing data, and class imbalance, using diverse metrics for comprehensive model evaluation.


#Information About Dataset

To dowmload the dataset, you need to go to this link : https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/training/#files-panel
The files for both training_setA and training_setB are quite huge and I am unable to upload here on Github.
When you the jupyter or pythin is run, it will automatically convert all the files from these datasets in a single file and then a lot of data cleaning and preprocessing is required due to data imbalance.
